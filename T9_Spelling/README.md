# T9_Spelling
A python solution for one of the sample questions from Google Code Jam
Convert letters into numbers on the phone keypad

For example: 
'a': you press number 2 once on the keypad = 2
'b': you press number 2 twice on the keypad = 22
'd': you press number 3 once on the keypad = 3

There's a pause in between if the number is pressed consecutively

abbd = 2 22 223
